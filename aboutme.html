<h2>Reflections</h2>
  <h4>June 19th, 2017</h4>
    <p>Debugging a program, even as simple as a shape drawer, had many nuances. Although it was rewarding to see bugs fixed, the process of fixing them was frustrating.</p>
    <p>The difficulty wasn't with finding the error persay, but with figuring out the solution. Most of the issues were with formatting.</p>
  <h4>June 20th, 2017</h4>
    <p>Today we learned about how photo filters work, lists, and indices.</p>
