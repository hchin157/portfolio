  <p>I'm Hannah Chin, obviously. I'm from New York. I'm almost done with high school, thank goodness.</p>
  <p>I like to play video games, fold origami, and draw. <del>I'm not that great at <i>any</i> of these things, though.</del> lol </p>
  <p>I'm not very fond of sports.</p>

<h2>Reflections</h2>
  <h4>July 19th, 2017</h4>
    <p>Debugging a program, even as simple as a shape drawer, had many nuances. Although it was rewarding to see bugs fixed, the process of fixing them was frustrating.
    The difficulty wasn't with finding the error persay, but with figuring out the solution. Most of the issues were with formatting.</p>
  <h4>July 20th, 2017</h4>
    <p>Today we learned about how photo filters work, lists, and indices.
    A list is a sequence of data. It's great for organizing data in a certain order.
    Working with a group or even a partner can be difficult. As long as there's communication, though, a group can succeed.
    The groups that worked best together seemed to be "on the same page."</p>
  <h4>July 21st, 2017</h4>
    <p>The "Obamicon" project was fun to work on. It was great to be able to make a photo more interesting with just a few lines of code.
    Most of the challenges that came with this project were because small syntax errors broke the whole program.
    Once again, although the command prompt will identify the first "problem" area, it is difficult to understand how to fix the error. Trial
      and error was the easiest solution. </p>
    <p>Each of the "Core 4" (loops, variables, functions, conditionals) were implemented into the project, except for a function.
      A <i>loop</i> was used to cycle through every pixel of a specified image.
      A <i>conditional</i> was used to assign a pixel a new color, based on its overall brightness.
      A <i>variable</i> was used to assign every pixel a (new) RGB value. </p>
    <p>If we had more time, I would have tried to create a filter that changes the overall color scheme of the picture. They look cool :D</p>
    <p>The filters were probably the <mark>highlight</mark> of the day.</p>
  <h4>July 25th, 2017</h4>
    <p>We learned how to build a series and a parallel circuit, using a few jumper wires, resistors, LEDs, and a breadboard.
    Similarly to code, the parts had to be assembled a certain way in order to get the circuit to run.
    Some difficulties we faced were with the parts. A few of the LEDs wouldn't light up, nor were all the ground ports usable.
    However, my group was able to work through.</p>
  <h4>July 25th, 2017 (cont.) </h4>
    <p>We learned more things today, who knew that would happen?</p>
    <p>In terms of women in tech, the class learned about Manuela Veloso and Ayanna Howard.</p>
    <p>Both of their work is in robotics, and how to use robots to make human lives easier. While Manuela Veloso is most interested in developing more advanced artificial intelligence, Ayanna Howard has made advancements in technology that is more accessible to those who have disabilities.</p>
    <p>Our team worked together to come up with ideas for light patterns, and to write code, obviously.</p>
    <p>We could have improved in working together, as opposed to the "divide and conquer" philosophy.</p>
    <p>Other groups used different patterns: alternating, the "wave" effect, etc.</p>
    <p>The basic pieces of any Arduino sketch involve a setup and a loop.</p>
  <h4>July 27th, 2017 </h4>
    <p>Circuits in general can be complicated. However, they can be used to power multiple things, whether it be a parallel or a series circuit.</p>
    <p>My favorite part of the robot's dance was the fact that it "danced" to the beat.</p>
    <p>Women like Manuela Venoso and Ayanna Howard need precise outputs from their robots in order to get data and improve them.</p>
