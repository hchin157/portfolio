  <p>I'm Hannah Chin, obviously. I'm from New York. I'm almost done with high school, thank goodness.</p>
  <p>I like to play video games, fold origami, and draw. <del>I'm not that great at <i>any</i> of these things, though.</del> lol </p>
  <p>I'm not very fond of sports.</p>
<h2>Reflections</h2>
  <h4>June 19th, 2017</h4>
    <p>Debugging a program, even as simple as a shape drawer, had many nuances. Although it was rewarding to see bugs fixed, the process of fixing them was frustrating.</p>
    <p>The difficulty wasn't with finding the error persay, but with figuring out the solution. Most of the issues were with formatting.</p>
  <h4>June 20th, 2017</h4>
    <p>Today we learned about how photo filters work, lists, and indices.</p>
    <p>A list is a sequence of data. It's great for organizing data in a certain order.</p>
    <p>Working with a group or even a partner can be difficult. As long as there's communication, though, a group can succeed.</p>
    <p>The groups that worked best together seemed to be "on the same page."</p>
  <h4>June 21st, 2017</h4>
    <p>The "Obamicon" project was fun to work on. It was great to be able to make a photo more interesting with just a few lines of code.</p>
    <p>Most of the challenges that came with this project were because small syntax errors broke the whole program.</p>
    <p>Once again, although the command prompt will identify the first "problem" area, it is difficult to understand how to fix the error. Trial
      and error was the easiest solution. </p>
    <p>Each of the "Core 4" (loops, variables, functions, conditionals) were implemented into the project, except for a function.
      A <i>loop</i> was used to cycle through every pixel of a specified image.
      A <i>conditional</i> was used to assign a pixel a new color, based on its overall brightness.
      A <i>variable</i> was used to assign every pixel a (new) RGB value. </p>
    <p>If we had more time, I would have tried to create a filter that changes the overall color of the picture. They look cool :D</p>
    <p>The filters were probably the <mark>highlight</mark> of the day.</p>
